Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

Why use inheritance in java ?
(a) For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
(b) For Code Reusability.

Types of inheritance in java :-
On the basis of class, there can be three types of inheritance in java: single, multilevel and hierarchical.
In java programming, multiple and hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only. We will learn about interfaces later.
